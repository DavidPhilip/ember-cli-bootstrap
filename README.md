ember-cli-bootstrap
===================

###Warning - this is still a WIP

This is an ember-cli addon that includes [twitter bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) into your ember-cli project.

This addon utilizes the [bootstrap_for_ember](https://github.com/ember-addons/bootstrap-for-ember) library, which provides a collection of Ember components based on Twitter Bootstrap V3.
You can find documentation for usage [here](https://github.com/ember-addons/bootstrap-for-ember).

#Usage

In the root of your ember-cli project directory, run:
```bash
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-bootstrap
```

You should now have access to bootstrap styles and the components
provided by [bootstrap_for_ember](https://github.com/ember-addons/bootstrap-for-ember). Enjoy!
